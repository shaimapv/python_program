# 1. string program(strigprob.py)

This is a simple Python program that allows users to analyze a given string. It provides three functionalities:

1. Count the number of vowels and consonants.
2. Check if the string is a palindrome.
3. Display the frequency of each character in the string.

##  Features

-  Vowel and consonant counting (case-insensitive)
-  Palindrome checker
-  Character frequency counter 

# 2. Demonstration of `file` and `flush` Parameters in Python's `print()` Function (fileflush.py)

## Description

This Python script demonstrates how to use the `file` and `flush` parameters with the built-in `print()` function.

- The script logs events to a file named `file.txt`.
- It prints 5 logging events with a 1-second interval between each.
- The `flush=True` parameter is used to immediately flush the output buffer to the file.
- At the end, it also shows how to use `flush=True` for console output.
- Finally, it writes one more line to the file without a delay.


# Python Operators(operators.py)

##  Description

This Python program is designed to **demonstrate the use of all major types of operators** in Python using a menu-driven approach. The user selects the type of operation, and the program then performs and displays the result for various operator types.

##  Features Covered

The following operator categories are demonstrated:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`
2. **Assignment Operators**
   - `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=`, `**=`
3. **Comparison Operators**
   - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
4. **Logical Operators**
   - `and`, `or`, `not`
5. **Bitwise Operators**
   - `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
6. **Special Operators**
   - Identity Operators: `is`, `is not`
   - Membership Operators: `in`, `not in`
