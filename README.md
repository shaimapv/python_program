# 1. string program(strigprob.py)

This is a simple Python program that allows users to analyze a given string. It provides three functionalities:

1. Count the number of vowels and consonants.
2. Check if the string is a palindrome.
3. Display the frequency of each character in the string.

##  Features

-  Vowel and consonant counting (case-insensitive)
-  Palindrome checker
-  Character frequency counter 

# 2. Demonstration of `file` and `flush` Parameters in Python's `print()` Function (fileflush.py)

## Description

This Python script demonstrates how to use the `file` and `flush` parameters with the built-in `print()` function.

- The script logs events to a file named `file.txt`.
- It prints 5 logging events with a 1-second interval between each.
- The `flush=True` parameter is used to immediately flush the output buffer to the file.
- At the end, it also shows how to use `flush=True` for console output.
- Finally, it writes one more line to the file without a delay.


# 3. Python Operators(operators.py)

##  Description

This Python program is designed to **demonstrate the use of all major types of operators** in Python using a menu-driven approach. The user selects the type of operation, and the program then performs and displays the result for various operator types.

##  Features Covered

The following operator categories are demonstrated:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`
2. **Assignment Operators**
   - `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=`, `**=`
3. **Comparison Operators**
   - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
4. **Logical Operators**
   - `and`, `or`, `not`
5. **Bitwise Operators**
   - `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
6. **Special Operators**
   - Identity Operators: `is`, `is not`
   - Membership Operators: `in`, `not in`

# 4. Display Monthly Calendar in Python

This is a simple Python program to display the calendar of a given month and year using the built-in `calendar` module.

##  Description

- The user is prompted to enter a **month (1–12)**.
- If the month is valid, the user is then asked to enter a **year**.
- The program prints the calendar of the specified month and year.

# 5. Display Monthly Calendar Using `datetime` Module

This is a Python program that prints the calendar of a specific month and year using only the built-in `datetime` module — **no `calendar` module is used**.

##  Description

- Prompts the user to enter a **year** and a **month (1–12)**.
- Calculates the number of days in the given month.
- Finds the day on which the month starts.
- Displays the calendar layout with correct weekday alignment starting from **Monday**.

# 6. XOR Operation in Python

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates the use of the **bitwise XOR (`^`) operator**.

##  What It Does

The program:
- Takes two integer inputs from the user.
- Performs a **bitwise XOR** operation on the two numbers.
- Prints the result.

# 7.Left Shift and Right Shift Operations in Python

This Python script demonstrates the use of **bitwise left shift (`<<`)** and **right shift (`>>`)** operators.

##  What It Does

- Takes two integer inputs from the user:
  - A number (`num1`)
  - A number of positions to shift (`num2`)
- Performs:
  - **Left shift** (`num1 << num2`)
  - **Right shift** (`num1 >> num2`)
- Prints the results.

# 8.Python Quiz Game
A command-line Quiz Game built using Python, designed to test your knowledge through 3 levels of multiple-choice questions. It uses all major control flow statements (if, elif, else, for, while, continue, break, pass, and ternary operators) — making it great for both fun and learning.

## Features
- Interactive quiz with 3 difficulty levels

- Score tracking and level-wise evaluation

- Must answer at least 2 out of 3 correctly to pass a level

- Option to replay the game after completion or failure

- Includes validation for correct answer input

- Uses all control flow concepts in Python
